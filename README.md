# Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Logic Formulas and Reward Machines

###### Evaluations of Different Q-value Composition Methods

Experiments in the OfficeWorld domain is included in the file `src/_my_office_world/Experiment1_final.py`.

Experiments in the MineCraft domain is included in the file `src/_my_craft/Experiment2_final.py`.

###### Evaluation of Different Representations of Target Tasks

Experiments in the OfficeWorld domain is included in the file `src/_my_office_world/Experiment4office.py`.

Experiments in the MineCraft domain is included in the file `src/_my_craft/Experiment4craft.py`.

###### Evaluation of LSRM

Experiments in the OfficeWorld domain is included in the file `src/_my_office_world/Experiment3office.py`.

Experiments in the MineCraft domain is included in the file `src/_my_craft/Experiment3craft.py`.

If run the experiment, set `is_plot=False`. If plot the result, set `is_plot=True`.

All the experiments use Q-values normalization, so `use_normalize=True`.
